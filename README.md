# Nodejs Express/Typescript Boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to speed up my API building process, adding some things such as folder structures, routes, setting up the server and linters.

## How to use it

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies with:

```
$ yarn
``` 

And start the development server with

```
$ yarn dev
```
